      The following is an abbreviated version of the Chicago Tribune piece "Curb Crime, Save Chicago" as part of their "New Plan of Chicago" series.
      %a{:href => "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/plan/ct-edit-xproject4a-crime-1027-20131027-story.html"} Please consider reading the full story here.

      %p Violent crime is often the most influential driver of urban instability. During one of Chicago's most violent years on record — 1992 — the Tribune surveyed adults of almost 3,000 households who left the city between April 1 and Oct. 31. The No. 1 issue was safety: Nearly 2 of every 3 respondents sought a safer place to live.
      %p Two decades later, Chicago faces a similar precipice. Crime on the South and West sides threatens to provoke out-migration similar to suburban flight of the 1960s and 1970s. Then, middle-class white families fled the city, destabilizing communities that never recovered. Now, middle-class black families wonder whether to flee. Areas such as Chatham — a sturdy, tidy outpost of police officers, teachers and small business owners — won't prosper if fear of crime takes an irreversible hold. And the Chatham area, which in the past year was among the city's most violent communities, isn't alone.
      %p Holding on to middle-class families ought to be easier now that … Chicago is so much safer than it was. In the early 1990s, this city averaged more than 900 homicides a year. Before a decline began accelerating in 2004, Chicago logged 600 or more homicides in each of 36 consecutive years, obliterating some 28,000 lives. Most victims were young minorities. The vast majority were slain in geographically limited parts of the city.
      %p Anti-crime tactics such as targeted policing have helped. Englewood, for example, has become safer: In 2012, homicides fell by 29 percent and shootings by 5 percent. But a city in which 30 percent of students quit high school and some areas have a 35 percent jobless rate is destined to have a high crime rate. That creates an exodus of the educated and employable, who move because they can.
      %p If we don't curb crime, if we don't prevent an exodus, we risk losing … Chicago.
