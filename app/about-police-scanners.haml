        %strong I want to hear my local police/fire, and don't know what I need?
        %br/
        %strong I just got this scanner, and I don't know what to do next?
      %p
        Don't worry, we've all been there. First off, welcome. You came to the right place. As a basic definition, scanning involves listening (and, at times, looking) on frequencies just below, above and around the standard FM and TV broadcast bands. There are numerous services that use this spectrum - from police and fire, to the guy that picks up your garbage and lots in between. The challenge comes when you decide what you want to hear and the equipment necessary.
      %h2#general-questions General Questions
      %p
        %strong What is a scanner? How can I decide which one is right for me?
      %p
        To start getting some answers, read our

        %strong Where can I look up some of this odd looking terminology? It's very confusing
      %p
        From stamp collecting to scanning and everything in between, there's often a bewildering amount of terminology and abbreviations, most specialized to the application that defines it. Our
        %a{:href => "http://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Category:RR_Glossary", :title => "Category:RR Glossary"} glossary
        is a category that has links that define numerous terms you will see on RR, along with several online glossaries that can be referred to for more information.
      %p
        %strong I'm told that my area is on a trunking system. What is this, and how can I understand how it works?
      %p
        Trunking can be loosely defined as a set of frequencies that are shared by numerous agencies. A better definition can be found in this

        %strong How can I program my scanner manually?
      %p
        Many feel that manually programming the scanner is the best way to learn about it. However, sometimes with the newer scanners, the instructions are obtuse, or very hard to follow. We have a category article with numerous
        %a{:href => "http://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Category:Programming_FAQs_and_Tips", :title => "Category:Programming FAQs and Tips"} FAQs and Tips
        that you may find helpful.

      %p
        %strong How can I hook up my PC to my scanner? Why should I want to do this?
      %p
        There are more than a few reasons for this - you travel a lot, and want to be able to load a new configuration quickly. There are too many channels to program manually. You wish to research your system. Whatever the reason, making the connection is problematic these days, because most newer PCs don't come with serial ports. They do however have USB ports, and we need a way to make the connection between the serial the scanner needs and the USB the PC needs. USB to serial converters abound, but there are some tricks you need to know to make it work correctly. Our

      %p
        %strong Where can I get software for my scanner? What is the best software for it?
      %p
        The 'best' software is often in the mind of the user, but there are some packages that are much more popular than others. See our

        %strong I now have the software and scanner, but I need to find data for my area
      %p
        In some cases, this is indirectly related to the software being used - the popular software seems to be those that can download data from our online databases. Once downloaded, the user can edit or change this data to fit their needs. To enable this function, one must first purchase a

        article.
      %p
        While using the database is a popular approach, another one is to obtain a file from someone - or another website - in a format that the software you are using can support. Two widely supported formats are comma seperated value (or
        = succeed ")" do
          %strong .csv
        %strong .usd
        files. These files are written by applications that support the newer Uniden scanners called the Uniden Advanced System Director (or UASD). These, and other formats, can be used as import sources. PDF files are

        There are a few tricks you need to know before making the connection. See our

        %strong Do I need an amplifier for my system?
      %p
        Hooking up an antenna outdoors, nice and high and away from obstructions, along with buying the right coax cable, are the best ways to increase the range of what you hear. The ScanTenna and various discones (such as those made by Diamond or Icom) are very popular, but there are others as well. Check the
        %a{:href => "http://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Scanner_Antennas", :title => "Scanner Antennas"} Scanner Antennas
        article for more. Be sure to buy the best coax you can - using cheap RG-58U or 59U at high frequencies can be very costly in terms of signal loss. Avoid amplifiers if you can, particularly if you live in an urban environment. These can cause issues with overloading and other complications.
      %p
        %strong I'm hearing (pagers, FM, TV audio) when scanning in some bands. Can this be alleviated?
      %p
        Unfortunately with the growth of urban areas, comes pagers and other unwanted services that show up in places you don't want to hear them. Consumer grade scanners can be susceptible to such interference. A temporary solution is to use the scanner's attenuator (if it has one), but this has the added consequence of reducing the scanner's sensitivity. A better solution is to add filters in between the scanner and antenna; see the filters section of the
