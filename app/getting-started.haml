    %h1#getting-started-with-chicagoscanner Getting Started with #ChicagoScanner
    %p Welcome to the Chicago scanner community! We've prepared these set of steps for you to get started.
  %section.col-md-6
    %h2#steps-to-becoming-a-successful-scanner-enthusiast Steps to becoming a successful scanner enthusiast
    %h3#scanner-ethics Step 0: Scanner Ethics
    %p
      As anyone with a scanner knows, what is heard on the air may be confidential or sensitive, either to victims, police/fire, or the general public. Thus, ethics is very important when listening to scanner traffic. Here at CrimeIsDown.com, we have developed our own code of ethics around listening to and reporting information heard on the scanner.
      %a{:href => "ethics.html"} You can view our set of rules here.
    %h3#buy-a-scanner Step 1: Buy a Scanner
    %p So you want to listen to CPD or CFD dispatches? You'll need a scanner to do this. But not just any scanner - we recommend getting a scanner with P25 digital decoding, as well as trunking capability, if you want to ensure you can hear all the different conversations. CPD uses convential analog channels around 460MHz, while CFD uses conventional digital channels around 477MHz. CPD also has a trunked system (Motorola) for special units.
    %p
      If you need help choosing a scanner,
      %a{:href => "http://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Scanner_decision", :target => "_blank", :title => "Scanner decision"} check out RadioReference's guide.
    %h3#program-the-scanner Step 2: Program the Scanner
    %p
      Once you have a scanner, you'll need to program it. We recommend using
      %a{:href => "http://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?ctid=606#cid-1327", :target => "_blank"} the RadioReference database for Cook County
      and adding in frequencies for the following (see below). If you own one of the Uniden DMA scanners (e.g. BCD396XT) we will be publishing a set of systems you can download and import.
    %ul
      %li
        %strong Chicago Police Department
        \- Zones 1-13, Citywide 1-8
      %li
        %strong Chicago Fire Department
        \- Fire Main+Englewood, EMS Main+Englewood, Citywide Fire, EMS Command, Fireground
      %li
        %strong Chicago Transit Authority
        \- All CTA lines, bus supervisors North+South
      %li
        %strong Aviation
        \- Helicopter UNICOM, Fixed-Wing UNICOM
      %li
        %strong Chicago Media
        \- As you see fit
        %a{:href => "http://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?aid=2820", :target => "_blank"} from this list.
      %li
        %strong CPD Trunked
        \- If you're up for the challenge, add in the
        %a{:href => "http://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?sid=581", :target => "_blank"} Chicago Public Safety and Services trunked system
        as well.
    %h3#start-scanning Step 3: Start Scanning!
    %p Got your scanner programmed? Time to start scanning! There's a lot you could potentially listen to, but for the most action we recommend you listen to the following:
    %ul
      %li CPD Zones 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13
      %li CPD Citywide 1, 2, 6 (10-1 simulcasts go out on all citywides)
      %li CFD Fire Main, Fire Englewood, EMS Main, EMS Englewood
      %li Helicopter UNICOM
      %li CPD Trunked TG352 (Mayor's detail), TG45072 (Marine Unit)
    %p
      Of course, there may be incidents which take place on a frequency other than these, so check our
      %a{:href => "tools.html#socialmedia"} Social Media Dashboard
      to see what other folks are listening to.
    %h3#make-tweaks Step 4: Make Tweaks and Adjustments As Needed
    %p
      Often you may need to make adjustments to the programming, antenna, or other equipment in order to hear more transmissions or hear them more clearly. We don't have any specific advice on what tweaks to make, but do
      %a{:href => "about-police-scanners.html#improvements"} check out our Scanning 101 page
      and see if you can find something helpful.
    %h3#record-what-you-hear Step 5: Record What You Hear
    %p
      Once you have a good scanner setup and you're listening, why not share what you hear with the world? There's a large scanner community on Twitter, providing breaking news to journalists and others. Check out the hashtag
      %a{:href => "https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23ChicagoScanner", :target => "_blank"} #ChicagoScanner
      and join in. Definitely follow
      %a{:href => "https://twitter.com/Chicago_Scanner", :target => "_blank"} @Chicago_Scanner
      and
      %a{:href => "https://twitter.com/SPOTNEWSonIG", :target => "_blank"} @SPOTNEWSonIG
      for great scanner tweets. Use our
      %a{:href => "tools.html"} scanner tools
      to include more information in your tweets.
    %p
      Note that when tweeting/reading tweets:
      "LOUD REPORTS are gunshots heard by police officers, which is different than Shots Fired, which are called in by the good citizen." -
